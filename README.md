# Word-to-Number-Converter
- A Program that Converts from 1 to 100000 (100000 may not be included)
- This was supposed to be a solution for the [ParseInt() reloaded](https://www.codewars.com/kata/525c7c5ab6aecef16e0001a5/train/python) problem on CodeWars
- The program was also meant to be able to convert from one to one million, but I was having issues doing that so it only works to probably one hundred thousand (100000)
